# BirdWatcher

BirdWatcher is a Discord bot that will track the new followers of a Twitter user. This bot is fully customizable, allowing you to track anyone with under 10,000 followers. Updates are sent out daily at 6am, 10am, and 2pm (your machine's local timezone).

## Important Info:

On February 9th, 2023 Twitter will begin charging users to use their API. This will make this bot unusable without paying for Twitter's API.
Basic Tier access is available, but this has made the BirdWatcher un-scaleable. See more info on the [Twitter API Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

## üöÄ Setup

Before running this on your local machine, you will need to do the following:

* Download and set up Node.js
* Create a new project in the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Save the `Bearer token`. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20Project%2C%20click,%2C%20description%2C%20and%20use%20case.)
* Create a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Save the `Token` and `Client ID Token`. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
* Create a new project in [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). Save the `Connection String`. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud-manager/tutorial/manage-projects/)

After you have the necessary requirements, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericksonl/BirdWatcher.git
cd BirdWatcher
npm install
```

After installation finishes, follow configuration instructions. Run `node .` to start the bot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root following this outline:

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit or share your token or api keys publicly ‚ö†Ô∏è

```html
DISCORD_TOKEN=<Discord Token>
CLIENT_ID=<Discord Client ID>

TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=<Twitter Bearer token>

DATABASE_TOKEN=<MongoDB Connection String>
```

## üïí Changing the update times
Locate line 64 in `bot.js`. Change the cron_value to your desired update times. Cron values are written in the following format:

| * | * | * | * | * |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minute | Hour | Day | Month | Day of the week

Examples: 
```js
cron_value = 5 * * * * //this will output every 5 minutes
cron_value = 0 5 * * * //this will output everyday at 5am
cron_value = 0 5 4 * * //this will output on the 4th of every month at 5am
cron_value = 0 5 4 5 * //this will output on the 4th of May at 5am
```

For additional help and info on cron values see their [official website](https://crontab.guru/)

## ‚ùó Important Info

* ~~Twitter has a rate limit of 15 requests per 15 minutes, and will return a max of 1000 followers per each request. This means you will be unable to track a user who has more than 15,000 followers. As a safegaurd, I capped BirdWatcher at 10,000.~~ As stated above, Twitter now has paid tiers. BirdWatcher requires AT LEAST a "Basic Tier," costing a whopping 100$ a month. This tier has a rate limit of 100 requests per 24 hours per user, and 500 requests per 24 hours per app. Each request will return a max of 1000 followers per each request.
